* **Introduction (Chapter 1\)  (3-5 pages)**  
  * **Background** \- Introduce the general area of research. Set the context and explain why the problem area is important.  
  * **Motivation** \- Explain why the problem you are working on is interesting, challenging and worth exploring. You should discuss what have been done in the domain (existing work) and their limitations, which motivate your research.  
  * **Problem Statement** \- Clearly define the specific problem or gap your research addresses.  
  * **Research Questions or Hypotheses** \- State the research questions or hypotheses you investigate. Research questions should align with the problem statement.   
  * **Research Objectives** \- List the specific objectives your thesis aims to achieve.  
  * **Scope and Limitations** \- Describe what your study covers and explicitly mention any boundaries or limitations. The research objectives should align with the research questions.  
  * **Scope and Limitations** \- Describe what your study covers and explicitly mention any boundaries or limitations.  
  * **Thesis Organization** \- Briefly describe the structure of your thesis (what each chapter will cover).  
* **Literature review (Chapter 2\)** **(20-30 pages)**  
  * **Overview** – Give an overview of the literature review you have done. You may not need to have a specific section heading for this. This should contain a categorization of the papers you have read, a hierarchical diagram showing the categories of research publications and example citations.   
  * **Content of the literature review.** \- You can have the next set of sections according to the categories you have identified and shown in the previous section. The number of sections depends on the research.   
    Under each category, organize papers according to identified insights/ patterns (e.g., main techniques, main problems addressed) of existing work rather than describing each paper and presenting a list of summaries.  
    At the end of each section, include a paragraph discussing how the work you have mentioned in that section relates to your research, e.g., are you improving that work, are you addressing limitations of that work, are you building on that work, are you using that work, etc.  
  * **Summary** – The summary should summarize all the work you have described in your literature review and motivate your research. Include a summary table that shows the novelty of your research. You can decide the columns of the table based on your research. These may be different aspects/characteristics of your research. Show how existing work have addressed those aspects. Usually, the existing work might only have addressed a subset of the aspects you have identified, and your research addresses all the aspects. However, this may differ based on your research.  
* **Methodology (Chapter 3\)** **(Number of pages depends on the research)**  
  * **Overview** – Give an overview of the methodology. This should include an overview diagram/system diagram of the proposed solution.   
  * **Design details of the proposed solution** – You can name the rest of the sections based on your research.   
  * **Implementation details**  
* **Experimental Study (Chapter 4\)** **(Number of pages depends on the research)**  
  * **Datasets**  
  * **Evaluation metrics**  
  * **Set of experiments** – This section varies depending on the research  
    * Explain how the experiment was conducted. If it is a comparative study, explain the baseline methods.  
    * Results and elaboration of results.  
  * **Summary of key findings** \- Highlight major results.  
* **Discussion (Chapter 5\)** **(2-3 pages)**  
  * **Interpretation of results** \- Explain what the results mean in the context of your research questions.  
  * **Comparison with existing work** \- Compare your findings to those in the literature.  
  * **Implications** \- Discuss the broader impact of your results, both theoretical and practical.  
  * **Limitations of the study** \- Be honest about the weaknesses of your study and possible sources of error.  
* **Conclusion and Future Work (Chapter 6\)** **(1-2 pages)**  
  * **Summary** \- Summarize the main contributions and achievements of the research.  
  * **Conclusions Drawn** \- Conclude based on your findings.  
  * **Recommendations for Future Research** \- Suggest ways to extend or improve the research.
